# Sheet_Music_Project_IEEENITK
IEEE NITK Signal Processing Society
Project Name: Optical Music Recognition
Academic Year: 2018-2019

Abstract

Optical Music Recognition is a use of machine vision to simplify the sight-reading process of sheet music for novice musicians and professionals alike. This project aims to use Python and OpenCV to develop an algorithm that will be able to interpret various musical notes and cues on a given sheet of musical composition. An additional objective would be to develop a computerized music playing system that interprets the sheet music and automatically plays the music as well.

The project will involve a fair amount of image processing and computer vision techniques.

Objectives

To develop an automated system to interpret sheet music to aid beginners, teachers and visually impaired individuals to read and play music.
